# **Devon Tyler Barber**

**Builder • Tiler • Construction Manager • Entrepreneur • Real-Estate Steward • Community Developer**

I work at the intersection of **craftsmanship, land stewardship, and community resilience**.  
My background is hands-on construction, but my focus is broader: building **durable physical systems** and **ethical operational structures** that serve people over the long term.

Much of my work is based in **New Jersey**, with an emphasis on practical sustainability, lawful development, and neighbor-first outcomes.

## **Professional Focus**

- 🧱 **Construction & Trades**  
  Tile installation, remodeling, waterproofing, maintenance systems, and build assemblies designed for longevity and code compliance

- 🏘 **Real Estate & Property Stewardship**  
  Long-term housing, property care, and responsible development—prioritizing habitability, safety, and stability over speculation

- 🌱 **Sustainable & Regenerative Systems**  
  Home gardening, soil health, water awareness, and food resilience at a human scale

- 🤝 **Community Development**  
  Projects and tools that support self-reliance, shared knowledge, and local capacity building

- 🧰 **Open Documentation & Tools**  
  Public workflows, references, and experiments intended to be useful—not performative

## **Current Priorities**

- Designing construction systems that **age well and fail safely**
- Encouraging **gardening and food independence** among New Jersey residents
- Documenting work with clarity so others can **verify, learn, or collaborate**
- Maintaining strict respect for **law, safety, and ethical boundaries**

## **Operating Principles**

- **Craftsmanship before scale**
- **Stewardship before extraction**
- **Transparency before promotion**
- **Durability before convenience**

I avoid fragile systems, excessive abstraction, and short-term thinking—whether in construction, technology, or land use.
